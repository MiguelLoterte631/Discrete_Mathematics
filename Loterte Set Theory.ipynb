    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the definition of complement, we have that $B^C = \\mathcal{U} - B$. We intersect both sides with the set $A$, and we get, $A \\cap B^C = A \\cap \\mathcal{U} - A \\cap B$ (by the distributive law). Then by the Domination law, $A \\cap \\mathcal{U} = A$, thus we get,  $A \\cap B^C = A - A \\cap B$. It follows by definition that $A \\setminus B =  A - A \\cap B$. Thus, $A \\setminus B = A \\cap B^C = A - A \\cap B$. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the Distributivity law, we have that $(B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^C) = B \\cap (A \\cup A^C)$. Since the union of a set and the set's complement is the universal set, it follows that by the Domination law, $(B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^C) = B$. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By De Morgan's Law, we can distribute the complement inside the parenthesis, and we have $\\bigcap_{i = 1}^{\\infty}(A_i^C)^C$. Then it follows by the Double Negation Law that, $\\bigcap_{i = 1}^{\\infty}(A_i^C)^C = \\bigcap_{i = 1}^{\\infty}A_i$. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1:** If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition of disjoint sets, their intersection is the empty set, thus $|A \\cap B| = \\emptyset$. It follows that the cardinality of the union of two sets is given by $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2:** If $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we count the size of both sets $A$ and $B$. Since we will be double counting the common elements of both sets, we subtract these common elements, thus their intersection $|A \\cap B|$. It follows that $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$.\n",

    "No. A counterexample is that the elements 3 and 5 are not included in $B$. For $A$ to be a proper subset of $B$, $A$ needs to be a subset of $B$, and also at least one element of $B$ is not in $A$. Since the first condition is false, we have the truth statement for $A \\subset B$ as $False \\land True = False$.\n",
